## cuda and opengl
In this project, I render julia set as a image, and use opengl 
to render this image. 
My main contribution in this project is implementing the interaction between 
cuda context and opengl context.
In my other project named 'learningcuda', I just render cuda image, and
transfer it to host, and transfer it to opengl. In this project, I just render cuda
image ,and give it to opengl.
